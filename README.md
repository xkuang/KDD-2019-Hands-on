Abstract
---
Learning from graph data has played a substantial role in many real world
scenarios including social network analysis, knowledge graph construction,
protein function prediction and so on. Recent burst of researches on Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) brings representation learning to non-euclidean space
and achieves state-of-art results in community detection, drug discovery,
recommendation, etc. More recent perspective begins to view GNN as a more
general form of the neural network models, such as attention architecture, that
have dominated areas of computer vision and natural language processing. As
graph is essentially relation, modeling explicit or inferring latent graph
structure is crucial to the ability of relational reasoning for model AI.

This tutorial focuses on this recent trend in geometric deep learning including
how and why graph neural networks are widely applied, its foundation and recent
development. We then introduce a new framework called Deep Graph Library (DGL)
that is designed to ease deep learning on graphs. The hands-on part starts with
basic concepts in DGL for easier understanding, and later walks the audience
through several end-to-end examples including community detection, hierarchical
clustering and building recommender system using GNNs.

Prerequisite
---

Basic understanding of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Have experience with
either Pytorch or Apache MXNet.
